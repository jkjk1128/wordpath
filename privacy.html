        <div class="updated">Last Updated: December 20, 2025</div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Word Hop ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our website and word puzzle game (the "Service").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Word Hop does not require user registration or account creation. We do not directly collect personal information such as your name, email address, or contact information unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., when contacting us via email).</p>

            <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <p>When you access our Service, we may automatically collect certain information, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interactions with the game, such as pages visited, time spent on the site, and gameplay statistics</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Browser type, operating system, device type, and IP address</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> Small data files stored on your device to enhance functionality and analyze usage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>We use browser local storage to save your game progress, preferences, and whether you've seen the tutorial. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

            <h2>2. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>

            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"), to analyze how users interact with our Service. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pages viewed and time spent on each page</li>
                <li>Session duration and bounce rate</li>
                <li>Geographic location (city/country level)</li>
                <li>Browser and device information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Analytics may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize ads of its own advertising network. You can learn more about Google Analytics' privacy practices at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

            <h3>Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>We display third-party advertisements on our Service through Google AdSense and other advertising partners. These companies may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deliver ads based on your interests and browsing history</li>
                <li>Measure ad performance and effectiveness</li>
                <li>Prevent the same ad from being shown to you repeatedly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Advertising</h2>
            <p>Word Hop uses Google AdSense and may use other third-party advertising networks to display advertisements. These advertising partners may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>

            <p>Third-party advertisers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information, which may include your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent on pages. This information is used for interest-based advertising (also called personalized or targeted advertising).</p>

            <h3>Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
            <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Please note that opting out does not mean you will no longer see ads; it means the ads you see will not be personalized based on your interests.</p>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <p>Word Hop is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@playwordhop.com">contact@playwordhop.com</a>, and we will delete the information.</p>
